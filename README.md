Here are **key technical interview discussion points** based on your **CPU Scheduling Simulator** project, organized by topic to help you confidently explain your contributions:

---

## 🔧 **System Design / Architecture**

1. **Modular Folder Structure**:

   * Cleanly separates `backend/`, `frontend/`, `data/`, and `server/`.
   * Enables maintainability and scalability (e.g., easily add new algorithms).

2. **Language Interoperability**:

   * C++ used for performance-intensive scheduling logic.
   * Node.js used as a bridge between the frontend and C++ backend.
   * JSON used as the communication format between layers.

3. **JSON-Driven I/O**:

   * Frontend sends process and algorithm data as JSON.
   * Backend processes it and returns a JSON response.
   * Easy to test, debug, and extend.

## 📊 **Algorithms & Implementation**

4. **Scheduling Algorithms Implemented**:

   * FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority (Preemptive/Non), RR, HRRN, Multilevel, MLFQ.
   * Interview Highlight: Explain the tradeoffs (e.g., starvation in SJF, context-switching in RR).

5. **Data Structures Used**:

   * `std::vector`, `std::queue`, and `std::priority_queue` for job queues.
   * Custom structs for process metadata (`arrival`, `burst`, `completion`, etc.).

6. **Gantt Chart Construction**:

   * Dynamically created based on execution trace.
   * Each algorithm populates the Gantt list (`gantt_chart[]`), later rendered on the frontend.

7. **Average Metrics Calculation**:

   * Waiting time = Turnaround - Burst.
   * Proper accounting for completion time and turnaround.

---

## 🌐 **Frontend + Backend Integration**

8. **Frontend in Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS**:

   * Lightweight UI for entering process data and selecting algorithms.
   * DOM manipulation used to dynamically add processes and render results.

9. **AJAX Communication**:

   * Uses `fetch()` to send/receive JSON from the backend.
   * Supports asynchronous updates (no page reload).

10. **Error Handling**:

* Handles server errors and invalid input (e.g., null `burst` or `priority`).
* Prevents crashes via basic frontend validation.

---

## 🧪 **Extensibility & Testing**

11. **Easily Extensible**:

* Just drop a new `.cpp` file with an algorithm and connect via `server.js`.
* Pluggable design — decoupled logic and UI.

12. **Testing Strategy**:

* Individual `.cpp` algorithms can be tested independently with custom `input.json`.
* Can automate testing by scripting inputs and verifying output JSON.

---

## ⚡️ Bonus Interview Points (Optional)

13. **Performance Optimization**:

* C++ backend enables fast simulation for 100+ processes.
* Time complexity awareness: SRTF uses priority queues for efficient preemption.

14. **Visualization**:

* Gantt chart provides an intuitive way to understand process scheduling.
* Shows real-time-like simulation in a stateless UI.

15. **Potential Features** *(Good to mention if you didn’t finish yet)*:

* Export to PDF/CSV.
* Add turnaround/waiting time plots.
* Process animation or timeline slider.

## 🎯 Suggested Elevator Pitch

> "I built a full-stack CPU Scheduling Simulator where the backend in C++ implements multiple scheduling algorithms, while the frontend provides a dynamic UI to input processes and visualize execution. I handled the JSON-based interface between frontend and backend using Node.js, and ensured the system is modular, efficient, and extensible."
